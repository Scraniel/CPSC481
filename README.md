watch movies or TV shows and/or look at pictures.
To start off, launch the UI from the directory in which it is. The home page will appear with three button
options. Click one of the following three buttons:

- 'Movies/Shows' Button: Select this if you'd like to watch a movie or TV show. The pre-loaded movies are shown
						 in the bottom scroll bar, with the currently selected one
