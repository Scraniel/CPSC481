This system provides children with an easy-to-use and intuitive interface on which they can seamlessly
watch movies or TV shows and/or look at pictures.
To start off, launch the UI from the directory in which it is. The home page will appear with three button
options. Click one of the following three buttons:

- 'Movies/Shows' Button: Select this if you'd like to watch a movie or TV show. The pre-loaded movies are 
						 shown in the bottom scroll bar, with the currently selected one shown in the bigger 
						 square window right above that. The options of things to do on this page are listed 
						 below:
						 - Scroll side-to-side through the movies with the left and right arrow buttons, which 
						 will also change the currently selected movie (as the middle thumbnail of the three 
						 in the scroll bar), but also clicking on one of the other two movies shown along the 
						 bottom will replace the bigger, current thumbnail.
                         - Clicking anywhere on the currently selected movie (the larger thumbnail in the 
						 middle of the screen), including the green play button overlaid on it, will put the 
						 movie into full screen mode and start playing it.
							- In full screen mode, there is an adjustable volume bar in the bottom right corner,
							as well as a back button in the top left.  If the mouse is hovered over the playing 
							video, fast forward and rewind buttons appear. Clicking on these will skip through 
							scenes, where as holding them down will slowly fast forward and rewind accordingly. 
							Clicking anywhere else on the video screen will pause it and minimize to the 
							previous screen. The video can then be played again by starting it the same way as 
							before (clicking anywhere on the preview of it).
						 - There are categories by which the movies can be sorted. Clicking the ‘Categories’ 
						 icon in the top right will bring down a list of categories to choose from.  Selecting 
						 one will refine the list of movies available in the bottom scroll bar. To view all 
						 movies again, simply go back to categories and select ‘All’.
						 - Click the Home (house icon) in the upper left corner to return to the home page.
						 - There is a toggle button on the middle left side of the page. When ‘Movies’ is 
						 highlighted, this is what is being displayed, and by clicking the other half the button,
						 labelled ‘TV Shows’, the populated movie thumbnails will be swapped out with the TV 
						 shows in the database, and vice versa for if ‘TV Shows’ is highlighted and ‘Movies’ is 
						 clicked.
						 - The only difference from here is that when ‘TV Shows’ is selected, an ‘Episodes’ bar 
						 is displayed in the central right region. The bottom scroll bar contains each different 
						 show that is in the database, while the ‘Episodes’ bar displays all the episodes of the 
						 currently selected show (the show that is in the larger square preview in the middle), 
						 in order of its’ seasons, if applicable.
						 - All other functionality is the same as when ‘Movies’ is selected, in terms of 
						 scrolling, selecting a show, playing it (the controls in fullscreen mode are the same 
						 too), selecting a category, and going back to the home page.

- 'Pictures' Button: Select this if you'd like to view pictures. The pictures are shown in the bottom scroll bar, 
					 with the currently selected one shown in the bigger square window right above that. By 
					 default, if the pictures have albums, the scroll bar is populated with pictures from the 
					 first album in the list. The options of things to do on this page are listed below:
					 - Scroll side-to-side through the pictures with the left and right arrow buttons, which will 
					 also change the currently selected picture (as the middle thumbnail of the three in the scroll 
					 bar), but also clicking on one of the other two pictures shown along the bottom will replace 
					 the bigger, current thumbnail.
					 - By clicking on the currently selected picture, the system enters full screen mode.
						- Full screen mode displays the enlarged image, its’ title (above it), a back button 
						(the same as in the ‘Movies/TV Shows’ full screen section, in the upper left corner) and a 
						slideshow button appear. Full screen pictures are by default in slideshow mode.  If the 
						‘Slideshow’ button in the top right corner is pressed, this toggles the slideshow mode 
						on/off. Left and right arrows beside the picture are also available to manually scroll 
						backwards or forwards through the images. Clicking the back button or anywhere on the 
						picture itself will return to the previous screen.
					 - A scrolling album viewer can be found in the middle left of the screen. This is a list of 
					 all the albums in the database, starting from ‘most recently viewed’ at the top, and going to 
					 the ‘least recently viewed’. Clicking on any of these album pictures (each album has a picture 
					 as a sample of what is in the album, and a name), will populate the bottom scrolling viewer 
					 with the pictures from that album.
					 - Click the Home (house icon) in the upper left corner to return to the home page.

- Power Icon Button: Shuts down the system.
